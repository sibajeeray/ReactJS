Best Project structure is created here, Where all Components will be inside components folder,
container folder contains App.js and it's related files.
assests folder should contains all the images used in the project.

StateFul component and StatelessComponent
---------------------------------------------
Here App.js is stateful and rest of all are stateless components. State object is not available in any
stateless component. Only props is available there.

But Stateful component can access both this.state and this.props.
