                                this if this component has any. and Call super(props) insode it.
                                State is initialised inside constructor.

2) componentWillMount() ----->  Use for updating state, last minute optimization

3) render()             ----->  Gets Rendered whenever state get changed. 

        ********RENDER THIS COMPONENTS AND ALLOF IT'S CHILD COMPONETS*********

4) componentDidMount()  -----> Executes after component ADN ALL OF IT'S CHILD COMPONENTS are 
                               successfully rendered.
