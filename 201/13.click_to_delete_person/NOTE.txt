onClick is added in <person> tag, which call deletePersonHandler on every clcik to splice that 
person from list.


If you have to change any state then 1st create a copy of that, then change, So that we can have
the original object for other operations.

const persons = this.state.persons does not create a copy of that object, it simply point to that object.

So use splice() or [...] spread operator to achieve a copy.
