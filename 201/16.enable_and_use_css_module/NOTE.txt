Till now we have used CSS as a global file. One css file style can be imported and use in
more than one JS file.

To scope one css with one js file, we have to enable css module. It will be then treated as a module class
just like anyother JS module. Other Css file also can not be overrided by another css style.


Enable CSS module
----------------------
Webpack is responsible to handle the css.
So we have to change the webpack configuration for this.
Expose all the react-script package and find the webpack configuration.

command : npm run eject -> It will expose all the configuration(Break the setup).

Edit webpack.config.dev and webpack.config.prod files
------------------------------------------------------------------
Find modules of the config files. Find .css extension inside module.
Edit the options of css-loader there.

Add these 2 lines mentioned below inside options of css module
******************************************************
modules: true,
localIdentName: '[name]__[local]__[hash:base64:5]',
******************************************************

this localIdentName will automatically assign one unique name to every class inside the css file.



Now import the css like a module in App.js.
import CssClasses(any name) form ./App.css;

Now we can use every class of css like {CssClasses.red} or {CssClasses.App}
