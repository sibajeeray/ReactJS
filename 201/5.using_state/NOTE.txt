props is used to pass dynamic data from one component to another component.

state is used to change data dynamically inside the same component it is declared.

props can be used in function componet also. But state can be used only in class component
where the calss must extends React.Componet. bcoz state is present in Component Class.

state is a javaScript Object.

Note:=> Any JS object we can use in our component to get dynamic value. But the speciality of state
is, the render() method execute and chage the DOM whenever any value of a state object get changed.


Always use setState() to change the value of the special object state. If we change it manually without 
setSate(), then the render() won't be called and the change won't be reflected in DOM.


In this example we are changing the state form one component i.e App.js and listening it from another 
component i.e Person.js.
