We will add style to Person componet here.

There are two ways of adding style to componet.
1) By External Css File
2) By Inline style 


By External Css File
----------------------
Add a css file with same name as componet to the same directory of that componet.
Still this file will be treate as global css. 
So add className attribute in root div of the component and in css use that class for styling purpose.
And then include this css file to your component.

Webpack will take care of importing css into JS which is generally not possible.

By Inline style
------------------
Create Object in render() of App.js and mention all your style there.
Then add this object to every HTML tag where u want to use this style as a property(props)


## Here inline style is used on the button.
