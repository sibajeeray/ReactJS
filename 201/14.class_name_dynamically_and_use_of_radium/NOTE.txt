In App.css we can create different style with css class scope, and then can assign it to
HTML tags as css class dynamically.

Here the Person Details paragraph's color will turn red if no of person become 2.
and the font of this paragraph will become bold when only one person will left in the list.


Radium
--------
The main disadvantage of inline style is we can not style sudo-selector(like hover).
For this we can use Radium package.

Import Radium to ur js file where u have to use it.
Then that component should be export as "export default Radium(App)" , bcoz Radium is a Higher order component. 
So we have to use radium() function to wrap up our react components. 

Now in our inline style we can use 
':hover' :{
    backgroundcolor :'lightgreen';
    color : 'black;'
}
