We use ngFor for looping a list in Angular.

But React is on pure JS.

So here the ES6 map() can be used to loop over a list.


Key Property
--------------
when listing our list by using map(), for each elemnt of the list, we should assign one key.
Otherwise react will give a warning ot console as
     Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop.

So while passing propz inside <Person>, mention another property key="unique_key", which might be the 
id of the perosn or the index of the list if no id is assigned.
